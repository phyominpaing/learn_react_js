# What is Rendering in React?

- **Rendering** is the process of React taking your components (written in JSX or JavaScript) and converting them into DOM elements that can be displayed on the browser.

**Key Points about Rendering :**
1. **Initial Render :**
- Happens when the app or a component is loaded for the first time.
- React creates a virtual DOM, compares it to the browser DOM, and updates the browser with the required elements.


2. **Virtual DOM :**
- React uses a lightweight copy of the real DOM called the Virtual DOM to determine what needs to be updated efficiently.

# What is Re-rendering in React?
Re-rendering happens when a component or part of the UI is updated because of changes in:

- State
- Props
- Context

React detects these changes and updates the UI by re-rendering only the affected components.

---

## Difference Between Rendering and Re-rendering:

| Rendering    | Re-rendering |
| -------- | ------- |
| Happens when a component is rendered for the first time.	  | $Happens when a component needs to update its UI.    |
| Converts JSX to real DOM for the initial display.	 | Updates the DOM to reflect changes in data (state/props).     |
| Example: When the app loads.	   | Example: When a button click updates a counter.    |


---


### Example of Rendering and Re-rendering:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1> {/* Renders the initial UI */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
1. **Rendering :**
- When the app loads, the h1 element displays "Counter: 0".

2. **Re-rendering :**
- When the increment button is clicked, the count state is updated, triggering a re-render.
- When you click the button, setCount updates the state, triggering React to re-render the h1 with the updated count.


---

### When Does React Re-render?
1. **State Changes :**
- If a component’s **useState** value changes, React re-renders it.

2. **Props Changes :**
- If a parent component passes new props to a child, the child re-renders.

3. **Context Updates :**
- If you use React’s **Context API**s, changes in context trigger re-renders of components using that context.

---

### Optimizing Re-rendering in React
- Re-rendering can sometimes slow down your app if not managed properly. Here’s how to optimize it:

1. **Use React.memo :**
- Prevents a component from re-rendering if its props haven’t changed.
```jsx
import React, { memo } from "react";

const Child = memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Rendered");
  return <div>{name}</div>;
});
```
2. **Avoid Unnecessary State Updates :**
- Only update the state if the new value is different from the old value.

3. **Use Keys in Lists :**
- Ensure React can identify which list items need updating using unique keys.

4. **Use useCallback and useMemo :**
- Prevents functions and values from being recreated unnecessarily during renders.

## Rendering: The Foundation ( Deep Dive )

- Rendering is React’s way of translating your JSX code into the actual UI that the user sees. It happens in two steps:

1. **Virtual DOM Creation :**
- React creates a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM called the **Virtual DOM**.
- The Virtual DOM allows React to efficiently compare changes without directly interacting with the browser's DOM.


2. **DOM Update :**
- React takes the Virtual DOM, finds the differences (diffing algorithm), and updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed. This process is called reconciliation.

---

#### Re-rendering: When and Why
- Re-rendering happens when React needs to update the UI because of changes in:
    - State
    - Props
    - Context

- When React detects these changes, it re-runs the component function to compute the new Virtual DOM, compares it with the previous one, and updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM.

---

#### Detailed Examples of Rendering and Re-rendering

**Example 1: State Change Triggers Re-rendering**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
1. **Initial Rendering :**
- The **h1** displays "Counter: 0".
- The Virtual DOM contains the initial representation of the UI.
    
2. **Re-rendering :**
- Clicking the button updates the state **(count)**.
- React recalculates the Virtual DOM for the component and updates the **h1** to reflect the new count.


---

**Example 2: Props Change Triggers Re-rendering**
```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Alice");

  return (
    <div>
      <Child name={name} />
      <button onClick={() => setName("Bob")}>Change Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Child({ name }) {
  console.log("Child re-rendered");
  return <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>;
}
```
1. **Initial Rendering :**
- The **Child** component renders with **name = "Alice"**.

2. **Re-rendering :**
- When the button is clicked, the parent state changes **(name = "Bob")**.
- The **Child** re-renders because it received new props.

---

**Example 3: Context Change Triggers Re-rendering**
```jsx
import React, { useState, useContext, createContext } from "react";

const UserContext = createContext();

function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState("Alice");

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Child />
      <button onClick={() => setUser("Bob")}>Change User</button>
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Child() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  console.log("Child re-rendered");
  return <h2>User: {user}</h2>;
}
```
1. **Initial Rendering :**
- The Child component renders with the context value "Alice".

2. **Re-rendering :**
- Clicking the button updates the context **(user = "Bob")**, causing the **Child** to re-render.

### Optimizing Re-rendering
- Re-rendering is necessary but can become a performance bottleneck if not handled well. Here are some strategies to optimize:

1. **React.memo**
- Prevents a component from re-rendering unless its props change.
```jsx
import React, { memo } from "react";

const Child = memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Rendered");
  return <div>{name}</div>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <Child name="Alice" />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Without **memo**, **Child** would re-render every time **Parent** re-renders.
- With **memo**, **Child** only re-renders if its **name** prop changes.


---

2. **Avoid Unnecessary State Updates**
- Only update state if the new value is different from the current value.
```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  };

  return <button onClick={increment}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```
- React won’t re-render if the state doesn’t actually change.

---

3. **Use Keys for Lists**
- When rendering lists, use unique keys to help React identify which items changed.
```jsx
function List({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

---

4. **useCallback and useMemo**
- **useCallback**: Prevents functions from being recreated unnecessarily.
- **useMemo**: Prevents values from being recalculated unnecessarily.
```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Button clicked");
  }, []);

  return <Child onClick={handleClick} />;
}

function Child({ onClick }) {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

---

## Summary

- **Optimization Tips:**
    - Use **React.memo** for memoizing components.
