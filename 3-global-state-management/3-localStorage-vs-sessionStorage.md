# Differences between localStorage and sessionStorage

## What is localStorage?

- **localStorage** is a feature in web browsers that lets you store data **locally on the user's browser**.
- The data is saved in a small, specific part of the browser's storage, not directly on the SSD.
- The data in **localStorage** stays saved **even after you close the browser** or **turn off your computer, unless itâ€™s manually cleared**.

---

## What is sessionStorage?

- **sessionStorage** is another feature in web browsers that lets you store data temporarily in the browser.
- The data in **sessionStorage** is erased as soon as the **browser tab or window is closed**.
- It is meant for data that is only needed for the duration of a single session.

### Key Differences Between localStorage and sessionStorage

| Feature       | localStorage                                                                         | sessionStorage                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Lifetime | Data persists until explicitly cleared by the user or programmatically.              | Data is cleared when the tab or window is closed.         |
| Storage Limit | 5-10 MB (varies by browser)                                                          | 5-10 MB (varies by browser)                               |
| Scope         | Shared across all tabs and windows of the same origin (website).                     | Unique to the specific tab or window.                     |
| Usage         | Used for long-term storage of data like user settings, login sessions, or app state. | Used for short-term storage like form data for a session. |
| Accessibility | Data is accessible from any tab or window for the same website.                      | Data is only accessible in the same tab or window.        |

#### When to Use localStorage vs sessionStorage?
1. **localStorage** :
- When data needs to be available even after the user closes and reopens the browser.
- Examples:
    - User preferences (e.g., dark mode).
    - Persistent login sessions.
    - App state (e.g., shopping cart).
2. **sessionStorage** :
- When data is only needed for the duration of a single tab or session.
- Examples:
    - Form drafts for a single page.
    - Temporary user data (e.g., search history).
    - Temporary state tracking while a user is on one specific page.

#### Security Considerations
1. **Both localStorage and sessionStorage** are not secure for sensitive information like passwords or credit card details because:
    - Data is stored in plain text.
    - It can be accessed through JavaScript, which is vulnerable to attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
2. For sensitive data, always use secure methods like server-side storage or cookies with proper security attributes.
