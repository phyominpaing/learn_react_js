# What is an API?

- **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and tools that allows one application to communicate with another. It's a way for two systems (like a frontend app and a backend server) to communicate with each other
- It acts as a bridge between different software systems, enabling them to interact and exchange data.
- When you use a website or app and it retrieves data from a server, it's likely using an API.
- APIs are used for various purposes, including communication between different software systems, data exchange, and integration with third-party services.
- For Example :
  - When you log in to a website, the app sends your login details to a server via an API.
  - The server processes the data and sends back a response like "Login successful."
- APIs usually use **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to communicate. The common data format for APIs is JSON.

**Real-World Analogy :**

- Imagine ordering food at a restaurant:

1. You **(the client)** give the waiter **(API)** your order **(request)**.
2. The waiter **(API)** goes to the kitchen **(server)** and tells them what you want.
3. The waiter brings back your food **(response)** to you.

- In this analogy:

1. **You** = **Client** (Frontend, e.g., React app)
2. **The waiter** = **API**
3. **The kitchen** = **Server** (Backend)

###### **Why Use APIs?**

1. **Data Sharing** : Enables access to data from another system or service (e.g., fetching weather data from a public API). APIs enable your application to fetch or send data to a server.
2. **Reusability** : Allows developers to use pre-built functionalities without recreating them (e.g., using a payment gateway API like Stripe).
3. **Decoupling** : Separates front-end and back-end systems, making them independent and easier to manage.
4. **Third-Party Integration** : Use APIs to integrate third-party services like payment gateways, social logins, or maps.

###### **How APIs Work**

1. **Request** : A client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends a request to a server.
2. **Processing** : The server processes the request and retrieves or modifies data.
3. **Response** : The server sends the requested data or a status back to the client.

#### Types of APIs

1. **REST (Representational State Transfer):**
- The most common type of API, uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
2. **GraphQL:**
- Flexible query language for APIs, allows fetching only the data you need.
3. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**
- An older protocol, mostly used in enterprise systems.
4. **WebSocket APIs:**
- Used for real-time communication, such as chat apps or live updates.

### How APIs are Structured
APIs are typically accessed through endpointsâ€”URLs that point to specific resources on a server.
**Example of a REST API Endpoint:**
```jsx
URL: https://api.example.com/users
```

1. **Endpoints:**
- Paths attached to the base URL to perform specific actions.
- **Example:**
    - GET /users (Fetch all users).
    - POST /users (Create a new user).

2. **HTTP Methods: Define what action to perform on the endpoint. The most common are:**
- **GET** : Retrieve data, Fetch data. (e.g., get a list of users).
- **POST**: Send data to server create a new resource (e.g., add a new user).
- **PUT/PATCH**: Update existing data (e.g., update user info).
- **DELETE**: Remove data from server (e.g., delete a user).

3. **Headers:**
- Provide metadata (e.g., authentication tokens, content type).
- Example : 
```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer token123",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```
4. **Body :**
- Contains the data sent with a request, mainly in **POST or PUT** methods.
- Example (JSON format):
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```
